Prevent Double Connections for FiveM and RedM

Each player can connect to the server more than once by sharing a steam account or even running the client multiple times which may allow bugs or exploits on our RedM or FiveM server. This plugin checks before entering server if player with specified steam id or rockstar license is not already connected and if he is it blocks connection.
